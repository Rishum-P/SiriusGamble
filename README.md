## Summary

The SpigotPlugin project is a template for creating a new project for the Spigot server implementation for Minecraft. It can compile out of box, but will do absolutely nothing without modification.

**Do not use the me.sgray namespace! Change to either use either an email account or domain name that YOU own.**

## Motivation

There's a lot of examples of how to create a pom.xml file for Maven-enabled projects, but very few designed to give a basis for Spigot plugins. The pom.xml in this project contains the most relevant and useful properties to someone creating a new plugin, including the necessary dependency on the Spigot API.

## Installation

Clone this git repository into your Eclipse workspace and go to create a new Java project. Eclipse should automatically detect the settings provided by this project and create anything missing. You will need to enable the Maven nature, easy as right-clicking the project root in Package Explorer, hovering "Configure", and clicking "Convert to Maven Project".

Additionally,

1. Rename the me.sgray.template.bukkitplugin package to reflect your own namespace. (tld.yourdomain.whatever)
2. Edit the pom.xml to reflect your project properties. Work slowly through this if you are still new to using Maven. A great reference about the available properties is at http://maven.apache.org/ref/3.2.3/maven-model/maven.html
3. Edit the plugin.yml file inside src/resources to add commands and permissions. Basic properties are handled with Maven property filters, notable by the ${property} syntax.

## Troubleshooting

**Eclipse says "JavaPlugin cannot be resolved to a type"**

Make sure you have the Maven nature enabled. Otherwise Eclipse won't know to read the pom.xml

**Plugin doesn't compile with error like "Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-compiler-plugin:3.1:compile (default-compile) on project BukkitPlugin: Compilation failure**
**No compiler is provided in this environment. Perhaps you are running on a JRE rather than a JDK?"**

Providing you *do* have the Java JDK installed and you're certain your system knows where to find it, just right-click the project in Package Explorer, hover "Maven", and click "Update Project". This is highly likely to resolve the matter.

## Make This Your Own

Feel free to (and please do) clone this project and make adjustments to fit your needs/preferences.
